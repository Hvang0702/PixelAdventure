# **PixelAdventure**
Unity 2d game that I created.

This project contains all the assets, code, and platforms used for creating a 2d Unity game. 

## **Background**
This is my first attempt at using the game engine Unity for a project. This personal project taught me a lot of things about real time events
and how to organize my code. Coding this project in C# was new to me and I really had to understand and learn more about the language. 
Overall I had a great time developing my own game and being able to put it out onto websites such as itch.io and unity.

## **Controls**
* Keyboard: Use the WASD keys to move the character.
* Jump: Use the spacebar to jump. (Hold down spacebar for longer and higher jump)

## **Gameplay**
This game has multiple levels that challenge the player to avoid obstacles and other traps such as spikes and certain animals. 
The objective of the game is to <ins>reach the end flag and collect as many apples as possible on the way to the end flag</ins>.
The player only has one life each map so if the player dies then the level will reset to the beginning.
